Using a reverse proxy such as Nginx or Apache HTTP Server in front of Apache Tomcat is a common practice for several reasons:

1. **Port Management**: It allows you to serve your application on the standard HTTP (80) and HTTPS (443) ports without running Tomcat as root (which is needed to bind to these lower-numbered ports).

2. **Security**: It can provide an additional layer of security, handling SSL/TLS termination and allowing Tomcat to operate in a more controlled environment.

3. **Load Balancing**: If you scale your application in the future, a reverse proxy can distribute traffic across multiple Tomcat instances.

4. **Static Content**: A reverse proxy can efficiently serve static content, offloading the work from Tomcat.

5. **Caching**: Reverse proxies can also cache content, reducing the load on the backend server.

If you want to use your domain (`http://tl.id.vn`) without specifying the port number, setting up a reverse proxy is the way to go. Here's how you would configure a basic reverse proxy with Apache HTTP Server, which might be more straightforward if you want to stick with Apache tools:

### Step 1: Install Apache HTTP Server

If you haven't already, install Apache HTTP Server:

```sh
sudo apt update
sudo apt install apache2
```

### Step 2: Enable Required Modules

Enable the `proxy` and `proxy_http` modules:

```sh
sudo a2enmod proxy
sudo a2enmod proxy_http
sudo a2enmod proxy_balancer
sudo a2enmod lbmethod_byrequests
```

If you plan to use HTTPS, also enable `ssl`:

```sh
sudo a2enmod ssl
```

### Step 3: Configure Apache as a Reverse Proxy

Create a new configuration file for your site or edit the default one:

```sh
sudo nano /etc/apache2/sites-available/000-default.conf
```

Add the following configuration to set up the reverse proxy:

```apache
<VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerName tl.id.vn

    ProxyRequests Off
    ProxyPreserveHost On
    ProxyVia Full

    <Proxy *>
        Require all granted
    </Proxy>

    <Location />
        ProxyPass http://localhost:8082/
        ProxyPassReverse http://localhost:8082/
    </Location>
</VirtualHost>
```

If you've set up SSL and want to handle HTTPS traffic, you would create a similar `<VirtualHost *:443>` block with `SSLEngine on` and directives to specify your certificate files.

### Step 4: Restart Apache

After making changes to the configuration, restart Apache to apply them:

```sh
sudo systemctl restart apache2
```

### Step 5: Update Firewall Settings

Ensure your firewall is configured to allow traffic on ports 80 and 443:

```sh
sudo ufw allow 80
sudo ufw allow 443
```

### Step 6: Test the Configuration

Now you should be able to access your Tomcat application via your domain `http://tl.id.vn` without specifying the port number.

Remember to check your cloud firewall settings as well to ensure that ports 80 and 443 are open to incoming traffic as needed.

To handle HTTPS traffic and set up SSL for your Apache reverse proxy, follow these steps:

### Step 1: SSL Certificate

Ensure you have an SSL certificate for your domain. If you don't have one, you can obtain a free SSL certificate from Let's Encrypt. Given that you already have SSL certificates as per your earlier message, you'll just need to locate your certificate files. Typically, these are:

- Full Chain file: `/etc/letsencrypt/live/tl.id.vn/fullchain.pem`
- Private Key file: `/etc/letsencrypt/live/tl.id.vn/privkey.pem`

### Step 2: Apache SSL Configuration

Create a new Virtual Host for HTTPS in Apache's configuration:

1. Open the SSL Virtual Host file for editing. If youâ€™re using the default SSL configuration file, you can edit it with the following command:

   ```sh
   sudo nano /etc/apache2/sites-available/default-ssl.conf
   ```

2. Add or modify the Virtual Host block to look like this, making sure to use the paths to your own SSL certificate files:

   ```apache
   <IfModule mod_ssl.c>
       <VirtualHost _default_:443>
           ServerAdmin webmaster@localhost
           ServerName tl.id.vn

           DocumentRoot /var/www/html

           ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/error.log
           CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/access.log combined

           SSLEngine on
           SSLCertificateFile /etc/letsencrypt/live/tl.id.vn/fullchain.pem
           SSLCertificateKeyFile /etc/letsencrypt/live/tl.id.vn/privkey.pem

           <FilesMatch "\.(cgi|shtml|phtml|php)$">
               SSLOptions +StdEnvVars
           </FilesMatch>
           <Directory /usr/lib/cgi-bin>
               SSLOptions +StdEnvVars
           </Directory>

           BrowserMatch "MSIE [2-6]" \
               nokeepalive ssl-unclean-shutdown \
               downgrade-1.0 force-response-1.0

           # Reverse proxy configuration
           ProxyRequests Off
           ProxyPreserveHost On
           ProxyVia Full
           <Proxy *>
               Require all granted
           </Proxy>
           <Location />
               ProxyPass http://localhost:8082/
               ProxyPassReverse http://localhost:8082/
           </Location>

       </VirtualHost>
   </IfModule>
   ```

3. Save the file and exit the editor.

### Step 3: Enable the SSL Site

If you've just created a new configuration file, you need to enable it. If you edited the default-ssl, it might already be enabled. Otherwise, enable it with the following command:

```sh
sudo a2ensite default-ssl
```

### Step 4: Enable the SSL Module

If you haven't already enabled the SSL module, do so with the following command:

```sh
sudo a2enmod ssl
```

### Step 5: Restart Apache

Apply all changes by restarting Apache:

```sh
sudo systemctl restart apache2
```

### Step 6: Test the Configuration

Access your website using `https://tl.id.vn` and verify that it loads correctly and that the browser indicates a secure connection.

### Additional Tips

- **Redirect HTTP to HTTPS**: If you want to force all traffic to use HTTPS, you can add a redirection from HTTP to HTTPS in the `<VirtualHost *:80>` block.
- **Firewall and Security Groups**: Make sure your server's firewall and any cloud security groups allow traffic on port 443.
- **Certificate Renewal**: Set up automatic renewal if you're using Let's Encrypt certificates, as they expire every 90 days.

After completing these steps, your domain should serve traffic over HTTPS, and your visitors can securely access your site.

--- Forward all http to https ---
To configure your Apache Tomcat server to automatically forward all HTTP traffic to HTTPS, you need to make changes to the Apache HTTP Server configuration, which acts as a reverse proxy for your Tomcat server. Here are the steps you should follow:

### Step 1: Modify Apache HTTP Server Configuration

You need to create a redirection from HTTP to HTTPS in the Apache configuration. Edit your Apache Virtual Host file for the non-SSL configuration:

```sh
sudo nano /etc/apache2/sites-available/000-default.conf
```

Add the following lines to the `<VirtualHost *:80>` section to redirect all HTTP traffic to HTTPS:

```apache
<VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerName tl.id.vn

    RewriteEngine on
    RewriteCond %{SERVER_NAME} =tl.id.vn
    RewriteRule ^ https://%{SERVER_NAME}%{REQUEST_URI} [END,NE,R=permanent]
</VirtualHost>
```

This configuration uses the `mod_rewrite` module to redirect all incoming HTTP requests to HTTPS.

### Step 2: Enable mod_rewrite

If `mod_rewrite` is not already enabled, you can enable it by running:

```sh
sudo a2enmod rewrite
```

### Step 3: Restart Apache

After making these changes, restart Apache to apply them:

```sh
sudo systemctl restart apache2
```

### Step 4: Verify the Configuration

After restarting Apache, test your website by accessing `http://tl.id.vn`. It should automatically redirect you to `https://tl.id.vn`.

### Step 5: SSL Certificate and HTTPS Configuration

Make sure your SSL Virtual Host configuration is correctly set up as you've done in the provided steps. This ensures that when the redirection happens, the HTTPS version of your site is served securely.

### Step 6: Firewall and Security

Ensure your firewall settings allow traffic on both ports 80 (for initial HTTP connections before redirection) and 443 (for HTTPS).

### Additional Notes

- The rewrite rule in the configuration provided will only redirect traffic for `tl.id.vn`. If you have more domain names or subdomains, you'll need to adjust the `RewriteCond` directive accordingly.
- Regularly check the status of your SSL certificates and renew them as needed, especially if you're using Let's Encrypt, which has a 90-day expiration on certificates.
- Regularly update your server software to ensure you have the latest security patches and features.
