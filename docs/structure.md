### Frameworks and Tools

-   **Servlet API**: To create your controllers for handling HTTP requests and responses.
-   **JSP**: For creating dynamic views that are rendered on the server side.
-   **JDBC or JPA/Hibernate**: For data access to handle CRUD operations with your database.
-   **Spring Framework**: For Dependency Injection, complex business logic, and integrating modules.
-   **Spring MVC**: If you decide to use Spring for your web layer in more complex scenarios.
-   **Spring Security**: For robust authentication and authorization, if you choose to integrate Spring.
-   **JUnit**: For writing your unit tests.
-   **Maven**: For managing dependencies and building your project (as indicated by your `pom.xml`).
-   **Docker**: For containerizing your application, making it easier to deploy.

### Additional Considerations

-   Make sure that your `pom.xml` includes all the necessary dependencies for the frameworks and tools you choose.
-   Use `.gitignore` to exclude files and directories that should not be committed to version control (like `target/`, `*.log`, `*.class`, etc.).
-   Document your REST endpoints if you create APIs for front-end interaction.
-   Always consider security implications, especially with user authentication, data validation, and session management.

This structure and these tools should provide a solid foundation for building a robust e-commerce platform. Remember that while JSP and Servlets are the primary technologies, using Spring for complex tasks can greatly simplify development, especially when it comes to security and transaction management.

Certainly! Here is a list of suggested URLs (endpoints) for each task in your e-commerce platform:

#### Common Controllers

-   `/home` - Serves the homepage.
-   `/about` - Serves the about page with information about the platform.

#### Customer Controllers

-   `/customer/account` - Serves the customer's account details page.
-   `/customer/cart` - Serves the shopping cart page.
-   `/customer/orders` - Lists the customer's orders.
-   `/customer/order/view` - View details of a specific order (might include an ID parameter).

#### Store Owner Controllers

-   `/store/dashboard` - Serves the store owner's dashboard.
-   `/store/products` - Lists the store owner's products.
-   `/store/product/add` - Form to add a new product.
-   `/store/product/edit` - Form to edit an existing product (might include an ID parameter).
-   `/store/orders` - Lists the orders received by the store owner.

#### Platform Owner Controllers

-   `/admin/dashboard` - Serves the platform owner's admin dashboard.
-   `/admin/users` - Lists all users with the ability to manage them.
-   `/admin/stores` - Lists all stores with management options.
-   `/admin/orders` - Lists all orders placed on the platform with management options.

#### Data Access Object (DAO) Operations

-   No direct URLs for DAO operations since they are typically called by services which are in turn invoked by controllers.

#### Service Operations

-   Services don't have URLs as they are part of the backend logic. They are utilized by controllers and are not exposed directly to the web.

#### Static Content

-   `/static/css/style.css` - URL for main stylesheet.
-   `/static/js/app.js` - URL for main JavaScript file.
-   `/static/images/logo.png` - URL for the logo or any branding images.

#### Views

-   Views will be rendered and served through their respective controller endpoints.

Remember to secure sensitive areas of your application, especially those that are part of the store and platform namespaces. This is usually done through session management and authentication middleware, which would redirect unauthenticated users to a login page and prevent unauthorized access to certain pages.

Also, if you are using RESTful design patterns, you should adhere to the conventions (e.g., using HTTP verbs like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE appropriately). If you're building a single-page application (SPA) or a mobile app, you would expose a RESTful API instead of serving JSP pages.

Keep in mind that the actual URLs can vary based on how you configure your web server and your `web.xml` file or your Spring Controller annotations if you're using Spring MVC.
